###Problem statement: 
How have the proportion of follow-up films in Hollywood changed over the past century?

The purpose of this investigation is to explore the evolution of follow-up films in Hollywood over time. Specifically, we focus on the time frame betwee 1900 and 2019 to investigate whether sequels, remakes, and reboots are more frequent today than they used to be. 

In order to only look at Hollywood movies, we limited movies to ones that were produced by companies based in the United States, were in English, and were produced in the United States. 

From the imdb database, we extracted follow-up movies by defining sequels to be movies that had a "followed by" information type, remakes to be movies that had a "remade as" information type, and reboots to be movies that had a "version of" information type.

###Findings:

From the plots above, we can see that the frequency of follow-up films has not increased over the past century. Although Hollwood may seem more repetitive today, our findings do not support this claim. One reason may be that there are more follow-up films advertised and featured in the media today, that makes it seem as though there is a rise in follow-up movies, while the follow-up movies only contribute to a small percent of the total movies produced. According to The Atlantic, "audiences are ignoring everything that isn't a sequel, adaptation, or reboot", which could possibly explain why top movies today may be related to multiple movies.

Another noticeable finding is the time period when the frequency increased. The peaks in the plots suggest that there was an increase in the frequency of follow-up films around the 1920s and 1960s. Viewing the trends of each individual type of follow-up shows that sequels make up most of the follow-up films, while remakes make up the least. 

The dramatic increase in the total number of movies as well as follow-ups at around 1920 can be explained by the events and cultural changes occuring in that time period.  

Exploring the history of Hollywood allows us to see that the early 1900s were when films advanced at a great rate. With new technology to produce movies, the entertainment industry was able to expand, with theaters even being used for propaganda during World War I. After the war, the film industry became a central part of American culture, with Hollywood dominating the industry. With the emergence of Hollywood, the 1920s were when many movies as well as movie stars emerged, which explains the peak in the plots at around 1920.

The frequency of follow up films also increases at around 1920 with the proportion being above 1.0. This can be explained by the fact that the queried sequels included many movies that were sequels of more than one movie. For example, the movie, "Your Last Act" (1941) followed "One Against the World", "Out of Darkness", and several other films. We chose to count all instances of sequel movies instead of counting only distinct movies, in order to capture a more accurate picture of the fequency of follow-up movies. 


It seems like there is a peak around 1920 in terms of the proportion of total follow-ups, especially sequels. So we decided to take a look at the original movies: 
```{r}
sq20<- sql_sequels %>% 
  filter(production_year_sequel <1930 & production_year_sequel>1915) %>% 
  select(movie, sequel_movie, production_year) %>% 
  group_by(movie) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),year= as.integer(mean(production_year))) 
```
```{r}
ggplot(sq20,aes(x = year, y = n))+
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, position ='jitter')+
  annotate("text",x=1915, y= 2600, color = "red",label = "Mutt and Jeff")+
  ylab("Number of Sequels")+
  ggtitle("Number of Sequels by Movie from 1905-1930")
```


There is a lot more Mutt and Jeff movie sequels than others!

###What is Muff and Jeff and why are there many more sequels than other films?
Mutt and Jeff is a long-running and widely popular American newspaper comic strip created by cartoonist Harry Conway “Bud” Fisher in 1907 about “two mismatched tinhorns”.  Mutt and Jeff is considered the first daily comic strip with continuing characters. They were among the first comic strip properties to successfully translate to the screen, and were the earliest animated characters to display appealing personalities attractive to working class America. 

In early July 1911, during the silent era of motion pictures, Al Christie began turning out a weekly Mutt and Jeff comedy short, which was based on the comic strip. The Mutt and Jeff serial was extremely popular and after the Nestor Company established a studio in Hollywood to take over the weekly production.
![Mutts & Jeff: 2 May 1909, 5 December 1909 27 February 1910, 6 June 1910](http://comicskingdom.com/system/media/3240_page3_original.png?1438796512 (332 kB))

By 1914, animated cartoons were becoming a regular part of the movie program. Many newspaper cartoonists lent their hand to the animation process with varying degrees of success. An animation contract for Mutt and Jeff was secured in 1916 with Charles Bowers and Raoul Barre’. Barre’ had the distinction of having established the first studio to produce animated cartoons for theaters, preceding the more famous Bray Studio.

The animated series lasted 11 years and more than 300 animated Mutt and Jeff shorts were released by the Fox Film Corporation, making it the longest continuing theatrical animated movie serial.

Therefore, it is likely that most of the Mutt and Jeff sequel movies in this database are shorts adapted from newspaper comic stips. We probably don't think of shorts as Hollywood movies nowadays, but it's nonetheless classified as such. We decided to explore more about Mutt and Jeff in relation to other Hollywood sequels.

###So what is the trend for Mutt and Jeff production?
We try to find all the movies, both sequels and origins, with "Mutt and Jeff" in the movie title, and calculate what poportion of the hollywood sequels is made up of this one franchise from 1910-1922.
```{r}
mj<-sql_sequels %>% 
  filter(grepl("Mutt and Jeff",sequel_movie)| grepl("Mutt and Jeff",movie)) %>% 
  group_by(production_year_sequel) %>% 
  summarize(counts = n()) %>% 
  right_join(totalcounts, by = c('production_year_sequel' = 'year')) %>% 
  select(production_year_sequel,counts,num_of_redos) %>% 
  replace_na(list (counts = 0)) %>% 
  mutate(prop_mj = counts/num_of_redos) %>% 
  rename (year = production_year_sequel)
```
```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(mj,aes(x = parse_integer(year), y = counts))+
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_line(aes(y = prop_mj/0.0006), color='red')+
  scale_y_continuous(name = "Total counts of Mutt and Jeff", sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . * 0.0006, name = "Proportion of Mutt and Jeff to all Sequels"))+
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1911,1922),breaks =c(1910,1911,1912,1913,1914,1915,1916,1917,1918,1919,1920,1921,1922),
name = "year", labels = c(1910,1911,1912,1913,1914,1915,1916,1917,1918,1919,1920,1921,1922))+
  theme(axis.text.y.right=element_text(color='red'))

```


From this graph we can see that although the production of Muff and Jeff franchise peaked at around 1920, consisting of almost 1600 movies, this sequel makes up less than 25% of the total sequels in the height of its years.  


##Conclusion  
From our database query, wrangling and visualization, we found that there were more follow-up movies in 1920s than in any other period. However, we think that our findings are limited because of the ambiguity of how we defined “follow-up movies” and “Hollywood.” For example, the definition of sequels is blurry, and the films classified as such might not be considered a sequel by ordinary contemporary audience. Also, the movies that are considered Hollywood nowadays might not be produced in the US any more. Moreover, since the 1900, the film industries has been through many changes, and what was considered a “movie” back then, which includes short comic strips, is different from a movie nowadays. In addition to the ambiguity in definition, the database does not contain any documentation that thoroughly explains how were the movie categorized and entered into the system. Overall, our data still showed a drastic spike of follow-ups around the 1920s, and we learned a lot about how movies have progressed over time in this project.
